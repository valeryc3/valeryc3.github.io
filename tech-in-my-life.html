<h2>Gentrification and Online Voting</h2>
<img  src="g.jpg">
<p>What is Gentrification? </p>
<p>
Gentrification is when low income people of color are being pushed out of their houses. This is often due to the growth of paying jobs available because of the economic growth. More people move in and causes the population to increase. The rent rises because there is a higher demand for housing. The landowners would more likely rent a house to a higher paying customer than to a lower paying. Which is why people in those communities have to move, due to the rise in rents.

<p>Create Better Communication Within Communities </p>
<p>
With online voting everyone in the community can have a voice about what is happening around them. People in the neighborhoods can get online on their phones, computers or  a nearby place like a library that offers free internet. This will make the community have better communication because people can get online and give an input of what them as a community should do to fix the problem. This technology can reach all the people in the community at the same time with one survey for them to vote. It is much faster to send one survey they to go all around or put paper which would be bad for the environment.

<p>Why Online Voting?</p>
<p>In LA there have been many test with online voting and they had successful turnouts. I believe that we can take that idea that has been working in other parts and we can adapt it to the problems we have and are trying to fix. </p>
