               <p> An future thinker is an person that thinks about his/hers future. In the present you think about what you can do to help your future. You think of what can happen based on your actions right now. You imagine how your life will look like and then you do things or make things happen in order to pursue the things you want for your future. You spend more time thinking about the future you can sometimes forget about your present.</p>

<p>I see this theme in my life when I do work for school or go to programs. This shows my theme because it shows how I think about what will happen in the future, how it would be better for me to start now. I take that thought and do what I have to do now to get to that thought. I think about how my actions are going to affect or help me in the future. I like to dream big because if I try to make it big if I fall I have many other good things to fall on.</p>

 <p>When I use my strength I feel scared, scared that I might not make it that I set goals so high that I can not access them no matter how hard I try. I also feel more powerful because I feel like i am challenging myself my setting higher goals for myself. Feeling accomplished is the best part because it feels like I did something great like all the hard work is paying of and it makes want to do it again with greater goals.</p>

            <th>
                <p>Being curious in life and every day wanting to learn more about life. I spend time thinking, asking question, and exploring things that get me engaged or intrest me. I ask questions and can often lead to more questions and ideas about a topic. I also ask questions if something is unclear and try to make it clear.</p>

<p>An example of me using it in like is doing arts and crafts because even though I am not good I like to discover new ways of doing things, fixing them, improving things makes me want to do more things. I like to learn things and learn new things everyday I did not know about. Another way I use this skill is doing science because I have to think a lot and think of different ways in which things happen and different ways to fix or to improve those things/reaction.</p>

<p>During the process of using my strength I might feel confused because I may not know what is going on. I might also feel engaged because what is going on I can understand it clearly and it craves my attention. I feel challenged in a good way because I want to find solutions or I have to ask questions in order to be able to get things that I am learning.</p>

            <tr>
              <p>Liking the feeling in which one succeeds. Having things that you want to accomplish before you have accomplished what you had first, being set for the future. You have bigger goals than other people because you think a lot.</p>
            <p>I use this strength when I play soccer because the goal in soccer is to make goals. One person can not do it by themselves they have to have a team and the thing that we are achieving is teamwork and even we do not win we will have had team. </p>
            <p>When I use my strength I feel well accomplished. I feel great like have done something good. I can sometimes feel bad because I can be so much into winning that i forget to play the game. It can be hard to balance just the right amount of what and how you want to accomplish things.</p>
