<h4>2a)</h4>
<p>The computing innovation I chose is iMessages.The purpose of  iMessage is to send messages through Iphones. It works by sending messages by an app on the iPhone.
This artifact shows that messages from iPhone to iPhone have blue bubbles. Messages from Iphone to none iPhone have a green bubble. I added an image that showed that you not only can send messages but also stickers music pictures and other things.
</p>
<h4>2b)</h4>
<p>I created this artifact by using a photo editing software. The software I used to create this artifact was Gimp. In gimp First, I added the title of the innovation. Then, I did then I moved on to the definition on my innovation. After that, I added images that relate to my innovation which was iMessage.

</p>
<h4>2c)</h4>
       <p>The impact to society this innovation has is harmful because using iMessage has become an everyday thing. The more you use iMessage the more information your phone has about you. In the occasion that someone steal your phone they steal your information from iMessage(3). Having your information stolen is harmful because if cyber criminals get a hold of your information they can blackmail or expose you. This innovation is beneficial because it creates better skills for us to communicate and share things with family and with friends. This would help us have a stronger relationship(1). On the other hand, this innovation is harmful because if you start off with an iPhone and switch to an android the text messages from iMessage do not transfer to the new phone the android. Iphone companies do not like the customers using android on a different phone on different systems phones so they punish them(2).</p>
<h4>2d)</h4>
<p>Imessage, an app on your phone, gets significant amount of data. The data the iMessage consumes is  the messages sent through, and the images. One example of that is the iMessage collects the data by imputing images from the phoneâ€™s camera. It processes that data by taking a photo or photos from photo library and compresses the size of the picture to fit in the iMessage app of receivers phone, in order to send it. This helps your phone or the receiver's phone save data(4). One data privacy concern is that Apple can read all the messages any time they want(2). This is a data privacy concern because there are things that you just do not want people to see and you want to keep private and by doing that it is invading privacy.
