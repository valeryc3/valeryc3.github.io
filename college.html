         <p>A potential major I want to have is biomedical engineering. This combines mechanical,chemical,and electrical engineering. With biomedical engineering you get to solve problems in many different ways. I am interested in this maher because I am persistent I work until I find  solution and that will be helpful for this major. The Act scores required for this college is 23-29 I have a 19 which is not good enough to be compatible but over time I can improve and get better and meat the standards or maybe pass it. For the PSAT in english I got 390 and math I got 520. The requirements for english are 480-600 and for math it is 550-690. I still need a couple of points but I can get better. The gpa standards are 3.94 and my gpa is on top of that standard which is good. I have to continue having my gpa at a 4.33 or higher for the next two years.</p>
            <tr>
               <p>In student life they have many centers and organizations. Some are multi-cultural center, a dream center and fresh basic needs hub. These are just a couple and can really help other students for example if I was in this school I would enjoy the multicultural and dream center because it not only helps the student in school but helps them feel a part of it.</p>
               <p>There are many services like students can have information about many things such as educational programs, housing, transportation, health insurance, and many more things. This is very helpful for students because they have somewhere or someone that can help them with questions they have about living or being a part of this school.

</p>
<p>Student life will help me grow because it will shelp me get to a good path in college. Having students be apart of different organizations will not only make the students become stronger but also for the school to become better.

                <p>A potential manager and Massachusetts institute of technology is software engenneir. I am interested in this maher because it is very hands on and you can be working on different types of things, projects. The Act scores required for this college is 33-35 I have around a  19 I am not quite on track yet. For the PSAT in english I got 390 and math I got 520. The requirements for english are  680-770 and for math it is  740-800. This school has a higher test score requirement and it might be harder to make it but with hard work anything can happen. My Gpa is on track because I have a 4.33 and the standards and 4.13. This means that I not only have to keep my grades the same or higher but I also have to improve on my test scores.

At MIT they have dance, music, museums, agriculture, media lab, creative writing, etc. this is good for students because they have a variety of things to do that will allow a student to experience more of what they like and what they find interesting.
</p>

<p>They have a lot of numbers that students are able to call. They have a student group that helps students and support them through their education. They have individual sevasis too. This is going to help students go forward in their education. Helps students grow instead of falling back because they have a lot of support.</p>
<p>Student life will help students grow because it opens up opportunities to the students to do what they enjoy and for other people to explore. It will improve the knowledge that other students have and can share.</p>

              <p>  A potential mager I want to study is pre-med. I have always wanted to study medicine and I think it is good to start with pre-med and move up learning different types. The sat scores for this school is Math 710-800, Reading 700-800,  these scores are still higher then what i am getting on the practice test. The act scores are 32-35 which is high for what I am scoring. My gpa at the moment is good enough because the standards are 4.04. </p>
      <p>There are about 400 student organisation involving extracurricular, athletic opportunities, for research in lab. I think I will enjoy this because having more classes that I like or watching sports would be fun. Instead of just having the classes you need you can find something fun to do with in college.</p>
 <p>There are many support services some are learning assisting, health and wellness, international student resources, doctoral student resources. I believe that knowing that they have these supports and more is good to know because many things can come up and having help there can help students grow.
</p>
<p>Student life will help me grow as a student because it will allow me to meet people which will help me have support or help from other students. Being able to go to do fun activities around the college will help me to be a little less stresses and more focused during the classes.
